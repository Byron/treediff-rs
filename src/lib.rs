//! **See what's different in arbitrary data structures**.
//!
//! The [main diff algorithm][diffalgo]
//! we implement here is less than a screen full of lines, yet it enables a vast amount of
//! applications.
//! It can work with all values implementing the `Value` trait.
//!
//! On top of it there is a [merge implementation][merge], which can be used to aggregate changes
//! into a target value. It works with `Value`s which implement the `Mutable` trait.
//!
//! # Usage
//! Please have a look at the tests for [diff][diff-tests] and [merge][merge-tests] tests.
//!
//! Also note that you will have to choose the features to build the library with in order to
//! get trait implementations for `Value` types of common libraries,
//! i.e. `cargo build --features=with-serde-json`.
